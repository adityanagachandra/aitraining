Project 1 : MNIST Detection
Welcome to our image classification project! This project lets you use a pre-trained model to recognize handwritten digits. You'll be able to upload your own images of numbers, and the model will tell you which digit it is. It's a fun way to learn how machine learning can be used to solve real-world problems. No prior knowledge is needed â€“ just follow the simple steps to see AI in action. The aim is to give you a hands-on experience and show you how technology can understand and classify images. Enjoy exploring the world of AI with us!


MNIST digit detection is crucial for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as it serves as a foundational benchmark. It allows researchers and practitioners to validate CNN architectures, ensuring they effectively learn visual patterns. Success on MNIST demonstrates a model's capability, guiding advancements in more complex image recognition tasks.
