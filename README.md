# AI Training Projects
EMC Summer Session A : Training Projects

Welcome to our image classification project! This project lets you use a pre-trained model to recognize handwritten digits. You'll be able to upload your own images of numbers, and the model will tell you which digit it is. It's a fun way to learn how machine learning can be used to solve real-world problems. No prior knowledge is needed â€“ just follow the simple steps to see AI in action. The aim is to give you a hands-on experience and show you how technology can understand and classify images. Enjoy exploring the world of AI with us!
